Hey there! I´m Nicholas, a 34 year year old student of Frontend Development.
I recently started studying at Medieinstitutet an I´m very excited to learn as much as I can, as soon as I can!

I live with my girlfriend Evelina, and our dog Ronja. We spend as much of our summers as possible out on our sailboat Embla, and the rest of the year we try to spend in the woods or by the sea.
