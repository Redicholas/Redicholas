Hey there! I´m Nicholas, a 34 year year old student of Frontend Development.
I recently started studying at Medieinstitutet and I´m very excited to learn as much as I can, as soon as I can!

I will be starting my first apprenticeship period in the autumn of 2023, and would love to find a medium sized company where I can focus on learning React.
But I am learning more everyday about what I think is fun the work with so I am open to any recommendations!
