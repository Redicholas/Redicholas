Hi there! I'm Nicholas, a 34-year-old student of Frontend Development currently studying at Medieinstitutet. I'm excited to learn as much as possible and to apply my skills in a real-world setting.

In the autumn of 2023, I will be starting my first apprenticeship period and am actively seeking opportunities to work with a medium-sized company, preferably in Gothenburg or with the possibility of remote work. My goal is to create easy-to-use and intuitive web experiences for users. I am open to any recommendations or suggestions for companies or projects that align with my interests and skills.
