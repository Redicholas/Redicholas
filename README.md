Hi there! I'm Nicholas, a 35-year-old student of Frontend Development currently studying at Medieinstitutet. I'm excited to learn as much as possible and to apply my skills in a real-world setting.

In the autumn of 2023, I will be starting my first apprenticeship period at Connectel where I will be using React and TypeScipt.
